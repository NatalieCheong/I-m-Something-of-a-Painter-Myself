# I'm-Something-of-a-Painter-Myself

This dataset is from Kaggle Competition.
This dataset contains two folders, 'monet' image folder and 'photo' image folder which contains images with jpeg and tfrec format. The images with size 256x256, RGB color space. 
For this project I have separate into three notebooks. The first notebook, I used CycleGAN and GAN model. The second notebook, I used Variational Autoencoder(VAE) model. The third notebook , I used two different pre-trained model for Style Transfer.
The pre-trained model for Style Transfer link: https://tfhub.dev/captain-pool/esrgan-tf2/1" and https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2.
